# Python_for_Data_Science_AI_and_Development
Analysis of Stock Performance and Dashboard Building

Welcome to my repository for the "Python for Data Science, AI & Development" course! This repository contains my work completed as part of this beginner-friendly, self-paced course, which offers a comprehensive introduction to Python programming for data science, AI, and software development.

## What I Learned

Throughout this course, I acquired a wide range of skills, including:

- Python fundamentals such as data types, variables, functions, and control flow.
- Working with essential Python data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- Data analysis and visualization using powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- Web scraping and programmatically accessing APIs to collect data.
- Automating tasks through Python scripting and programming.

The course's hands-on labs and exercises were conducted using Jupyter Notebooks, allowing me to apply the concepts covered in video lectures effectively. This repository includes example programs and code samples from these labs.

## Why This Repository

By completing this course, I've built a strong foundation in Python and essential skills applicable to roles in data science, AI, data analytics, and software development. This repository serves as a documentation of my work and a valuable reference for Python best practices.
