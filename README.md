Welcome to the repository for the "Python for Data Science, AI & Development" course! This repository contains my work completed as part of this beginner-friendly, self-paced course, which offers a comprehensive introduction to Python programming for data science, AI, and software development.

## Tools and Libraries Used

In the course, I utilized a set of powerful tools and libraries to enhance my Python development skills:

### Tools:
- **Python:** The primary programming language for this course, used for data manipulation, analysis, and scripting.
- **Jupyter:** Jupyter Notebooks were employed for interactive coding, data exploration, and documentation.
- **GitHub:** This repository is hosted on GitHub, where I manage version control and collaborate on projects.
- **IBM Watson Studio:** I used IBM Watson Studio for a more integrated and collaborative data science and machine learning environment.
- **IBM Cloud Pak:** This platform provided additional cloud-based resources and tools for data science and AI development.

### Libraries:
- **Pandas:** A versatile library for data manipulation and analysis, crucial for handling structured data.
- **NumPy:** The foundation for numerical operations in Python, especially useful for working with arrays and matrices.
- **Matplotlib:** A powerful library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Plotly:** An interactive graphing library that allows for the creation of interactive, web-based data visualizations.

## What I Learned

Throughout this course, I acquired a wide range of skills, including:

- Python fundamentals such as data types, variables, functions, and control flow.
- Working with essential Python data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- Data analysis and visualization using powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly.
- Web scraping and programmatically accessing APIs to collect data.
- Automating tasks through Python scripting and programming.

The course's hands-on labs and exercises were conducted using Jupyter Notebooks, allowing me to apply the concepts covered in video lectures effectively. This repository includes example programs and code samples from these labs.

## Why This Repository

By completing this course, I've built a strong foundation in Python and essential skills applicable to roles in data science, AI, data analytics, and software development. This repository serves as documentation of my work and a valuable reference for Python best practices.
